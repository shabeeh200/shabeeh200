### üî≠ Projects & Experiences
I love working on projects. Here are a few highlights :

- **Virtual Internship at Forage**: Participating in virtual internships to gain real-world experience and understand the industry environment better. Recently completed the J.P. Morgan job simulation where I interfaced with a stock price data feed and set up a system for data analysis.
- **Playtopia**: A website to download games zip files.
- **Homevice**: Collaborated with team members to create a user-friendly interface on figma.
- **Final Year Project (FYP)**: Currently focusing on my final year project, **Plantify**. Plantify is a platform that connects people who care about reforestation and environmental sustainability. It offers tools to create, join, and manage green campaigns, allowing users to donate, volunteer, and suggest areas for reforestation. The platform includes a social network where plant enthusiasts can share tips, connect with each other, and even adopt plants. It also features a marketplace for buying and selling plants, along with eco-friendly challenges to inspire personal growth. We are building it using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
